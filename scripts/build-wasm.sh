# Build the rammap-core lib crate. The lib's crate name is `rammap`, so the
# wasm-pack output stays rammap.js / rammap_bg.wasm. wasm-pack writes to
# rammap-core/pkg; relocate it to the repo-root pkg/ so the web/ demo's
# `../pkg/rammap.js` import resolves. (`--out-dir` is avoided: wasm-pack forwards
# it to cargo as the nightly-only `--artifact-dir`.)
